          The internet has proven over time to be the <em>most lucrative platform</em> for businesses of all categories
          to thrive. Billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk built businesses around the internet and have reaped
          massive success as a result.

          No matter how small or big your business may be, a well designed website will guarantee your access to more
          consumers in need of your unique product or service. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that you have a
          website that is professional and comprehensive, potraying the most compelling parts of your business. You must
          not compromise quality or functionality when building one.
        </p>

        <h3>Access to more customers</h3>
        <p>
          The internet has over 2.4 billion visitors every day and 81% of them perform online research before making a
          purchase. If your business does not have a good online presence, you're missing out on a huge number of
          potential customers.
          <br>
          With a website optimized for search engines like Google and Bing, your business will get more visiblity which
          will translate to much more business leads and clients.
        </p>

        <h3>Constant Availability - No more "Closed for Business"</h3>
        <p>
          A well designed website allows your business to be open 24/7. Customers can stop by at any time to get
          detailed
          information
          about your business, make purchasing decisions or interact with embedded chatbots to get more details about
          what they need. <br>
          An online store in your website will drastically boost sales as it gives your access to customers beyond your
          region of operation
          and timezone. <br>
          With chatbots, you have a sales representative or customer support personnel who is always available to
          interact with your
          potential customers and point them in the right direction.
        </p>

        <h3>Most customers expect it</h3>
        <p>
          We a living in the information age and people now prefer going to the internet to get relevant and accurate
          information
          over personal interaction. Recent studies have shown that 60% of consumers expect companies to have
          professional websites
          for reference and credibility. <br>
          Customers may need detailed information about your product or service and the way your website presents such
          information will
          create an impression about how refined and credible your business is. Most customers will quickly look
          elsewhere if you don't
          have a website that portrays your business in the most professional and compelling way.
        </p>

        <h3>Easy customer referral and recommendation</h3>
        <p>
          You may not have the time or even the capacity to communicate all the intricate parts of your business to an
          inquisitive
          high value customer, but you can always refer them to your website to get more detailed information about what
          they need. <br>
          Most customers are already looking online get other peoples recommendation about a particular brand or
          product,
          so including
          client testimonials on your website can dramatically boost the confidence of potential customers in your
          business.
        </p>

        <h3>Your competition already has one</h3>
        <p>
          Most businesses are fast awakening to the benefits of having a well designed professional website. The earlier
          you get yours
          ready, the quicker you improve your ranking on various search engines like Google and Bing. If your company's
          website shows up as the
          first result on Google when users search for a product or service you offer, that will dramatically boost your
          sales and cement
          your position as the top while your competitions fight to catch up.

          A lot of startup owners are sceptical about approaching professional website designers because they expect
          an excessive price tag and do not fully comprehend the positive impact a professional website can have in
          boosting
          their business. <br>
